## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of FoodLane (Static Restaurant App)! This simple web application is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to showcase a static representation of a restaurant's website.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to be responsive and accessible across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Menu Display with Categories:** Display the restaurant's menu with categories such as appetizers, main courses, desserts, etc. Each category should be visually distinguishable and easy to navigate.

- **Category Filters:** Implement filters that allow users to view specific categories of items. Users can click on a category, and the menu should dynamically update to show only items from that category.

- **Search Bar Filter:**

> Search Functionality: Include a search bar that enables users to search for specific items or keywords within the menu.

> Dynamic Filtering: As users type in the search bar, dynamically filter the displayed menu items to match the entered keywords.

- **Seat Booking Feature:**

> Interactive Seat Map: Provide users with an interactive seat map where they can view available seats and book their preferred ones.

> Reservation Form: Include a reservation form where users can select the date, time, and the number of seats they want to book.

- **Contact Information:** Easily find the contact details and location of the restaurant.

- **Interactive Elements:**

> Shopping Cart with Local Storage: Implement a shopping cart that stores selected items locally on the user's device. This ensures that the cart retains its contents even if the user refreshes the page or closes the browser.

> Item Button: Include an interactive item button that allows users to add items to their shopping cart with a single click. The button should update the cart and reflect the current number of items in it.
